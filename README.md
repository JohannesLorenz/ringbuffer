# 1 What is ringbuffer?

`ringbuffer' is a simple library containing a
[ringbuffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer).

The ringbuffer is lock-free (using atomics only), and allows multiple readers,
but only one writer.

The ringbuffer is real-time safe, i.e. guarantees that the functions return
"fast enough" (except to initialization and cleanup routines).

Parts of the code have their origin in
[JACK's ringbuffer](https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/blob/develop/common/ringbuffer.c).

# 2 Why using ringbuffer?

As mentioned, the advantages are:

 * minimality
 * no dependencies
 * lock-freeness while still supporting multiple readers
 * real-time safety
 * safety (tests are included)

# 3 License
